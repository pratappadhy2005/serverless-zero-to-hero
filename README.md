 # Serverless Development Guide

A hands-on, end-to-end guide to serverless development, taking you from fundamentals to production-ready architectures. Learn how to design, build, deploy, and scale serverless applications using real-world examples and best practices.

 ## Overview

 This repository is the home for your serverless experiments and projects as you progress from basic concepts to advanced architectures. It is intended to collect code samples, reference implementations, and exercises that demonstrate how to build modern serverless systems.

 ## What You Will Explore

 - Core serverless concepts and building blocks
 - Designing event-driven and microservices-style architectures
 - Implementing serverless APIs and background processing
 - Observability, monitoring, and operational best practices
 - Patterns for security, reliability, and cost optimization

 ## Using This Repository

 As you work through your serverless learning journey, you can:

 - Add example services and functions for different use cases
 - Experiment with infrastructure-as-code templates
 - Practice deploying and iterating on serverless applications
 - Capture patterns and reference solutions you want to reuse

 ## Suggested Next Steps

 - Decide on your primary cloud provider and serverless framework
 - Initialize your first service or function within this repository
 - Document each example or pattern you add so it is easy to revisit later
